üö® Extremely Important Security Warning

‚ú® Features
/start: Initializes the bot and displays the security warning.

Direct Command Execution: Any text message is executed as a shell command.

Persistent Working Directory: All commands are executed within a predefined PROJECT_DIRECTORY, and you can navigate using cd.

Real-time Output: Get the standard output and error of your commands sent back to you on Telegram.

Long Output Handling: Outputs longer than 4096 characters are automatically split into multiple messages.
