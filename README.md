Telegram Web App Deployment Bot
This is a Python-based Telegram bot that allows you to execute shell commands on a server, making it easier to deploy web applications.

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Extremely Important Security Warning ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
This bot can provide full terminal access to your server. If misused or if it falls into the wrong hands, your server could be completely compromised. Use this at your own risk.

Keep Your Bot Token Secure: Do not share your TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN with anyone.

User ID Whitelisting: The bot will only listen to commands sent from the ALLOWED_USER_ID. This is a basic security measure.

Server Security: Ensure that your server is also protected by other security measures.

Features
/start: Starts the bot and displays the security warning.

Direct Command Execution: Any text message sent (other than /start) is executed as a shell command.

Working Directory: All commands are executed in a predefined PROJECT_DIRECTORY.

Output/Error Reporting: The standard output and standard error of the command are sent back to you on Telegram.

Long Output Handling: Long outputs are split into 4096-character chunks before being sent.
